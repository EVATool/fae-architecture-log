## Why is there need for such a decision?

We need to have one (central!) location for all documentation, since the project is supposed to live on, after
FAE has been finished. 

## Additional sources for better understanding the background

* Github wiki documentation
* additional options like e.g. Confluence or Teams


## Viable Options

(Please list those options that you seriously consider as a possible solution. Simple bulleted list with a brief 
1-sentence explanation is sufficient.)


## Alternatives not seriously considered

(Here comes a list of alternatives that you can exclude right away, without an in-depth evaluation. Format: 
Simple bulleted list with a brief 1-sentence explanation is sufficient.)



## How is this decision evaluated?

Alternatives are fairly obvious (see "additional sources"). Decision criteria is the goal to start an open source
project. Hands-on evaluation is not really needed in this case - using a Github wiki is a no-brainer.
 
## Resolution Details

Documentation will be stored in the wiki of repo evatool-backend.

## Reasons for the resolution

In this case, decision is easy. To initiate a proper open source project, the documentation needs to be 
publically accessible. That leaves only Github wiki as a viable option.
