## Why is there need for such a decision?

If we expose entities over APIs and events, a uniform way of dealing with IDs is very helpful.

## Viable Options

1. DB-generated IDs for PKs and for API exposure
1. UUID for PKs and for API exposure
1. "Double" approach: DB-generated IDs for PKs, UUID for API exposure


## Alternatives not seriously considered

none


## How is this decision evaluated?

Architectural considerations, experience from earlier projects. 

 
## Resolution Details

We will use UUID for PKs and for API exposure (option 2).

## Reasons for the resolution

The problem with DB-generated IDs (option 1) is that you expose a "technical" ID to the outside world. Technical
means: It has been generated outside your active control, and it might be subject to change if you decide to 
migrate to another form of persistence. By exposing it via API, you make it quasi-permanent, since clients 
can hang on to the URLs. (See also the sources listed above.)

Usage of UUIDs (option 2) is a viable and pragmatic way out of this dilemma. Harrison (2017, see above) makes the 
point that one needs to be aware of possible performance concerns, and proposes a "double" approach (option 3): an 
"internal" generated ID, which is performance-efficient for SQL databases, and a UUID for external exposure. 

However, experience from earlier projects (see [Projektb√∂rse Prox](prox.innovation-hub.de)) and considerations 
about the expected load make this argument seem nectlectable. Therefore, the pure UUID solution seems appropriate.
