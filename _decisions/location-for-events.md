## Why is there need for such a decision?

Events used by the domains need to be visible for the other domains. In order to achieve this, a not domain specific structure
has to handle the events. 

## Additional sources for better understanding the background

n/a


## Viable Options

* the project includes a package global to store events


## Alternatives not seriously considered

n/a



## How is this decision evaluated?

## Resolution Details

Due to the change in the project structure a different approach for events is needed.
The package global will be a package within the application. All domains have to store the events in the subpackage 'event'.

The resolution is described in the [wiki](https://github.com/EVATool/evatool-backend/wiki/eventlocation).



## Reasons for the resolution
