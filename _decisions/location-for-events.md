## Why is there need for such a decision?

Events used by the domains need to be visible for the other domains. In order to achieve this, a not domain specific structure
has to handle the events.

## Resolution Details

Due to the change in the project structure a different approach for events is needed.
Instead of having a 'global' module to save  the events. The events now will be stored in the domain specific packages.
This package must be public, so the other domains can access the defined events.
