## Why is there need for such a decision?

Sometimes synchronous calls between APIs are necessary. Therefore, a decision dealing this issue is required. All APIs 
must use the same way of synchronous communication.

## Viable Options

* Api calls


## Alternatives not seriously considered




## How is this decision evaluated?

(**Before** you start working in this, please write down how you will evaluate this decision, and plan to 
come to a resolution. 
It is  **not sufficient** to perform a brief Google search, and then write  the "result" down. Any decision must
**always** be based on a thorough evaluation - if possible hands-on, i.e. by coding a brief proof-of-concept.
if this doesn't apply, then some other means of proper research must be given here - e.g. an evaluation of 
the most relevant literature or IT community sources.) 

 
## Resolution Details

(If the resolation cannot be explained in 1-2 sentences, usually this section would contain a link to some
documentation in the Github wiki.)


## Reasons for the resolution

(Please explain in 1-2 sentences, why you ultimately opted for this resolution, and not for an alternative one.)
