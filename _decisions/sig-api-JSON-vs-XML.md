## Why is there need for such a decision?

Based on the Api style the different data representations are easier to implement. 

## Additional sources for better understanding the background

* [Differences between JSON and XML](https://rapidapi.com/blog/types-of-apis/)
* [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-de.html)
* [XML](https://wiki.selfhtml.org/wiki/XML)

## Viable Options

- JSON

## Alternatives not seriously considered

-XML : GraphQL does not support XML syntax. Moreover XML is not as flexible.

## How is this decision evaluated?

The Used Api-Style ist the main reason for choosing XML or JSON. After the decision for the api style has been taken, both data formats
are going to be tested with the style. on behalf of that a decision can be taken, considering speed, usability etc.


 
## Resolution Details

Resolution Details can be found on the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/EVATool/evatool-backend/wiki/JsonXMl).


## Reasons for the resolution
 
Both considered api styles are not made to use XML format.
