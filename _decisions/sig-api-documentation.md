## Why is there need for such a decision?
The API-Documentation describes the entire
API. The goal should be that all API Endpoints be automatically documented. Moreover, by using the same API-Documentation Tool. That will be easier to generate the API Docu.
In addition to that, it will be easier to understand API Endpoints.

All Teams must use the same API-Documentation Tool to reach this goal.

## How is this decision evaluated?

(**Before** you start working in this, please write down how you will evaluate this decision, and plan to 
come to a resolution. 
It is  **not sufficient** to perform a brief Google search, and then write  the "result" down. Any decision must
**always** be based on a thorough evaluation - if possible hands-on, i.e. by coding a brief proof-of-concept.
if this doesn't apply, then some other means of proper research must be given here - e.g. an evaluation of 
the most relevant literature or IT community sources.)
