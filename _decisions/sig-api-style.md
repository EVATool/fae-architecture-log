## Why is there need for such a decision?

The Api-Style defines the way users  can access the provided resources. The Goal should be that all APIs can be accesses the same Way so the Client/User does 
not need different ways to access.  
All Teams must use the same style to reach this goal.

## How has this decision been evaluated?
To take the decision, research is necessary. Therefore, the differences between the different API-Styles have to be evaluated.
It is important that after the research the preferred Styles are implemented to compare them directly und to get familiar with those styles.
With the results of the research a decision based on facts and experience can be taken.

(**Before** you start working in this, please write down how you will evaluate this decision, and plan to 
come to a resolution. 
It is  **not sufficient** to perform a brief Google search, and then write  the "result" down. Any decision must
**always** be based on a thorough evaluation - if possible hands-on, i.e. by coding a brief proof-of-concept.
if this doesn't apply, then some other means of proper research must be given here - e.g. an evaluation of 
the most relevant literature or IT community sources.) 

 
## Resolution Details

(If the resolation cannot be explained in 1-2 sentences, usually this section would contain a link to some
documentation in the Github wiki.)


## Reasons for the resolution

(Please explain in 1-2 sentences, why you ultimately opted for this resolution, and not for an alternative one.)
