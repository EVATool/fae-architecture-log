## Why is there need for such a decision?

The Api-Style defines the way users  can access the provided resources. The Goal should be that all APIs can be accessed the same way, so the Client/User does 
not need different ways to access. Moreover, by using the same api style it will be easier to extend the functionality of the api. In addition to that it will be easier
to understand. 

All Teams must use the same style to reach this goal.

* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
* [REST Levels](https://blog.restcase.com/4-maturity-levels-of-rest-api-design/)
* [Building a GraphQL API - video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRnu7xvU1_Y)

## Viable Options

- REST level 2 
- REST level 3
- GraphQL



## Alternatives not seriously considered

- Soap : not considered because it produces a lot of Overhead due to XML syntax 
- gRPC : not considered because it is made for realtime use cases, which is not required here


## How is this decision evaluated?
To take the decision, research is necessary. Therefore, the differences between the different API-Styles have to be evaluated.
It is important that after the research, the preferred styles are implemented as prototype to compare them directly and get familiar with those styles.
With the results of the research a decision based on facts and experience can be taken.

Different aspects are going to be relevant for
the decision:
- Usability
- an existing documentation of the protocol
- standards  
- does it fulfill all relevant aspects needed for the communication between backend and frontend
- Safety of the protocol


 
## Resolution Details

(If the resolation cannot be explained in 1-2 sentences, usually this section would contain a link to some
documentation in the Github wiki.)


## Reasons for the resolution

(Please explain in 1-2 sentences, why you ultimately opted for this resolution, and not for an alternative one.)
