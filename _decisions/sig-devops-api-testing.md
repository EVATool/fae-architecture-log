## Why is there need for such a decision?

API calls must be tested like any other runnable code in a project.

## Additional sources for better understanding the background

(Please list some sources where a reader can get a better understanding of the topic at hand)

## Viable Options

- Mocking: Mocking the API calls.
- Hosting: Hosting a dummy server and testing API calls on that server.

## Alternatives not seriously considered

- Program test: Testing the API by running the program.

## How has this decision been evaluated?

The options will be scrutinized in regard to:
- Amount of resources/documentation
- Easy of usage
- Cost (must be free)
- How well they fit into existing parameters (automation, easier integration, less overhead)



(**Before** you start working in this, please write down how you will evaluate this decision, and plan to 
come to a resolution. 
It is  **not sufficient** to perform a brief Google search, and then write  the "result" down. Any decision must
**always** be based on a thorough evaluation - if possible hands-on, i.e. by coding a brief proof-of-concept.
if this doesn't apply, then some other means of proper research must be given here - e.g. an evaluation of 
the most relevant literature or IT community sources.) 
 
## Resolution Details



(If the resolation cannot be explained in 1-2 sentences, usually this section would contain a link to some
documentation in the Github wiki.)

## Reasons for the resolution



(Please explain in 1-2 sentences, why you ultimately opted for this resolution, and not for an alternative one.)
