## Why is there need for such a decision?
The application needs to be hosted. There are several ways to do this.
The application can be run on a physical server.
It can be packaged in a container or run in a virtual machine.
All of these approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages.
These have to be weighed up.

(Please explain in 1-2 sentences why this is necessary to decide, and why it is a decision on the respective level
must / should / team)

## How is this decision evaluated?

(**Before** you start working in this, please write down how you will evaluate this decision, and plan to 
come to a resolution. 
It is  **not sufficient** to perform a brief Google search, and then write  the "result" down. Any decision must
**always** be based on a thorough evaluation - if possible hands-on, i.e. by coding a brief proof-of-concept.
if this doesn't apply, then some other means of proper research must be given here - e.g. an evaluation of 
the most relevant literature or IT community sources.)
