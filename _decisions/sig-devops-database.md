## Why is there need for such a decision?

There are many different database systems for different purposes. It is therefore important to find a database system that is useful for our project.

## Additional sources for better understanding the background

[Comparing Database Management Systems: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL Server, MongoDB, Elasticsearch and others](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/comparing-database-management-systems-mysql-postgresql-mssql-server-mongodb-elasticsearch-and-others/).
Here you can find the different database systems and their basic structure e.g. Relational and Non-Relational database systems.

## Viable Options

* MYSQL 
* Maria DB


## Alternatives not seriously considered

* IBM DB2
* Oracle DATABASE
* S4 Hana SAP
  
Commercial database systems are unsuitable for open source projects.


## How is this decision evaluated?

(**Before** you start working in this, please write down how you will evaluate this decision, and plan to 
come to a resolution. 
It is  **not sufficient** to perform a brief Google search, and then write  the "result" down. Any decision must
**always** be based on a thorough evaluation - if possible hands-on, i.e. by coding a brief proof-of-concept.
if this doesn't apply, then some other means of proper research must be given here - e.g. an evaluation of 
the most relevant literature or IT community sources.) 

 
## Resolution Details

(If the resolation cannot be explained in 1-2 sentences, usually this section would contain a link to some
documentation in the Github wiki.)


## Reasons for the resolution

(Please explain in 1-2 sentences, why you ultimately opted for this resolution, and not for an alternative one.)
