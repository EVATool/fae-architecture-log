    - title is a little bit misleading / generic (this is about a specification method, really, right?)
    - how do you decide this?
    - as part of this decision, you need to provide some guidelines for the teams (or moderate the design/specification
        process yourself)   
    - such guidelines need to be described in the wiki (not here!)

## How is this decision evaluated?

(**Before** you start working in this, please write down how you will evaluate this decision, and plan to 
come to a resolution. 
It is  **not sufficient** to perform a brief Google search, and then write  the "result" down. Any decision must
**always** be based on a thorough evaluation - if possible hands-on, i.e. by coding a brief proof-of-concept.
if this doesn't apply, then some other means of proper research must be given here - e.g. an evaluation of 
the most relevant literature or IT community sources.) 

 
## Resolution Details

documentation in the Github wiki.)


## Reasons for the resolution

(Please explain in 1-2 sentences, why you ultimately opted for this resolution, and not for an alternative one.)
