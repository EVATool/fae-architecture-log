## Why is there need for such a decision?

Firstly it's important to create a matching domain model. Therefore this way we can consider the main objects of the domain and their relationships. With this method, the whole improved understanding for the domain will lead to a better implementation.

## Viable Options

Best practice at this point is the domain model…

## Alternatives not seriously considered

… This is the reason why no other alternatives were considered.

## How is this decision evaluated?

Based on the [wireframe]( https://lsw4em.axshare.com/prototype/login/lsw4em#id=wvfe6y&p=website) and the given [Excel-file](https://github.com/Archi-Lab/elsi-by-design-excel/), a first version of the domain model will be created. This version will be improved with several attributes and relationships.

## Resolution Details

Further documentation details on the specific [wiki](https://github.com/EVATool/evatool-backend/wiki/Analysis#domain-model-analysis) page.

## Reasons for the resolution

The design-decision for the domain model is needed to work with the whole domain itself.
