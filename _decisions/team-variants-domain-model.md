## Why is there need for such a decision?

A domain model should be created to get a better understanding of the domain. 

## Additional sources for better understanding the background

Evans, E. (2003). Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software (1 edition). Addison-Wesley Professional.

## Viable Options

 * informal diagram

## Alternatives not seriously considered

An informal modeling was chosen to avoid the restrictions of other diagram types. 

* entity relationship diagram
* uml diagrams 
    * class diagram
    * component diagram
    * etc.

## How is this decision evaluated?

Additional UML-compliant diagrams can be created as the project progresses. However, it was decided that an informal model would be sufficient for initial domain coverage.

The decision was based on the available wireframes and a technical discussion.

## Resolution Details

## Reasons for the resolution

The model was created and further developed in an iterative process.
