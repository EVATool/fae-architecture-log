## How is this decision evaluated?

(**Before** you start working in this, please write down how you will evaluate this decision, and plan to

**always** be based on a thorough evaluation - if possible hands-on, i.e. by coding a brief proof-of-concept.
if this doesn't apply, then some other means of proper research must be given here - e.g. an evaluation of 
the most relevant literature or IT community sources.)

documentation in the Github wiki.)
