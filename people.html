<h1>People, Memberships, and Decisions</h1>

<p>
    Here is a list of everyone in the FAE course. As this needs to be a public repo (otherwise Github Pages are
    not allowed), we won't use real names here. Instead, everyone is identified by a 3-letter acronym (one letter
    first name, two letters last name). This means that "Stefan Bente" goes as "SBE".
</p>
<p>
    In addition, the table lists team and SIG memberships, and decision(s) the person is responsible for.
